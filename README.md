Create a container with the width of 40% of the whole screen width (it should be squared);
Get user input of how many pixels should be in a single row and column from 16 to 100px (it's the same number);
Devide the number of pixels with the width of the container to get the width and height of a single pixel.
Use a loop to generate the rows and columns with pixels;
Add an eventListener to change color of pixel when it's hovered over;
